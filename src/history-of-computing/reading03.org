* The Battle
  The most obvious difference between console and computer is the
  interface. A keyboard just has so many more buttons! You can customise
  key-mappings and attribute complex sequences to a single keypress. And
  a mouse has proven to be faster and more accurate than a d-pad or
  joystick for most applications. Combine that with the left and right
  clickers and a clever game designer won't even need the keyboard.

  Next up is the difference in technology. These are the relase dates
  for the Playstation consoles: 1995, 2000, 2006, and 2014. That means
  graphics can't get any better, processors can't get any faster, and
  games can't get any bigger for 5 to 7 years. Not to mention the
  systems are designed years before release, so the technology is
  necessarily already outdated when the first customer purchases the
  console. PC's do not suffer the same way; their hardware can be
  updated at will. This also aloows computer gamer designers to design
  with an eye towards the future; relying on the promise that certain
  technological advancements will have been made by the time their game
  is ready.

  So it's really these differences that underpin the cultural
  differences between the two paradigms. PC's have incredible interface
  and technological capabilities, at the price of steep learning curves
  and maintenance. Consoles have technological limitations, but they
  carry a promise to the customer to 'just work'. It's always easier to
  put a cartridge into a slot than it is to install software. You can be
  upside down on a sofa 20 feet from your big screen TV and use a
  controller, but you have to be upright at a desk to use a mouse and
  keyboard.

  And so naturally video-game consumers diverge along these
  lines. Players looking for a catered, streamlined, 'casual' experience
  will find themselves leaning towards console gaming. Players looking
  to micro-manage their own experience look towards a PC to provide that
  level of customization. Studios are aware of this divide, and produce
  games accordingly. You won't find games like Civilization or Star
  Citizen on consoles because they are incredibly complex to play and
  require complex interfaces and interactions that are only suitbale for
  mouse and keyboard. Likewise the most popular console games like Super
  Mario Bros. or Fifa will not be the most popular PC games because
  they're just more fun and more comfortable on a console.

* Early PC Games
** Apple II
	 I never owned an Apple II, and I don't think I've ever interacted
	 with one. I have vague memories of Macintosh computers in our
	 computer lab back in kindergarten in 1998, but I don't think they
	 were Apple II's.

	 Despite having no personal history with the machine, I'm very aware
	 of its place in history, so I was excited to explore this platform
	 first.

*** Strip Poker - Melissa & Suzi
		Lol, just kidding. I didn't play that game. For class anyway.

*** Pacman
		I'm starting here because so far it's a good standard to compare
		platforms - everybody's gotta have a Pacman clone.

		The first thing I noticed was the weird colors

		[[./pacman-1.png]]

		I was under the impression that the Apple II was
		monochromatic. After some research I've found that color on the
		Apple II was [[https://www.xtof.info/blog/?p=768][/not simple/]]. On top of that there were a few
		different versions of the Apple II, so it's difficult to know what
		exact configuration is being emulated. Suffice to say, when color
		on the Apple II is just one of Woz's famous hacks, and operates
		like it; notice the low resolution and interference between
		adjacent colors. In light of these quirks, I assume some
		compromises must be made graphically, like the size of the fruit.
		[[./pacman-2.png]]

		The Apple II did not have up/down arrow keys, only left/right, so
		Pac-Man uses A and Z for up and down. It's weird for me, but
		probably somewhat natural on that hardware. The game feels a
		little slower than the arcade version, but leaps and bounds ahead
		of the Atari 2600 version!

*** Lode Runner
		I decided to try this game next because I've never heard of it,
		but it's on everybody's top ten Apple II list. Of note, it's the
		first game to feature a level editor! It's a puzzle and platformer
		mix, again another first.


    The game starts off with a fancy [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_transition#Iris_wipe][iris wipe]], [[./lode_runner-1.png]] so
		that's pretty impressive. The designer has chosen his color
		pallete to minimize interference. The gameplay feels really
		smooth, and only one hand is required (i, j, k, l, u, o), so the
		game is very easy to get sucked into right away.

		I got to level 3 before deciding to move on. I know, pics or it
		didn't happen.
		[[./lode_runner-2.png]]

		This game was really excellent, and still the work of only one
		person, Doug Smith. The idea of putting the power of creative
		expression into the player's hands is an, ahem, /game changing/
		innovation.

** DOS
	 I'm not sure if I've ever interacted with a real DOS machine. I
	 barely remember the first computer my family had; it was about the
	 size of a microwave and I didn't touch it because if I did I would
	 probably get blamed for the crashes that plagued the damn thing and
	 destroyed my parents' unsaved work. It might've been running
	 Windows 95, maybe Windows 3.X, or maybe DOS. Can't remember.

*** Pac-Man
		The graphics are much closer to the arcade version than many other
		platforms. They nailed the melodic sound effects used during
		transitions, but the gameplay sounds are terrible. They replaced
		'wacka-wacka' with varying siren sounds that are just grating. It
		also appears the color pallete was restricted to the spectrum
		between green and red, which is not nearly as appealing as the
		bright neons and high contrasts of the arcade game. The speed
		seems closer to the arcade than other platforms, but still a
		little too slow. For an off-brand port it's alright, but I can't
		get sucked into it like the arcade version, it's just that little
		bit off.

		I mean seriously, these colors look like a set of 70's
		plastic-ware.

*** Prince of Persia
		I picked this out because I played its successors on Playstation
		2, and they were fantastic!

		Boy, this game isn't like those /at all/. I mean, the protaganist
		is male, it takes place in Persia, and he can jump, kinda, but
		that's where the similarities end. This character is *sluggish*. I
		feel like I'm pushing him through the effects of a poorly timed
		Ambien. I have to press jump 2 steps before the gap. The climbing
		mechanics are obscure. The field of vision is so small I get a
		claustrophobic sense, but I can't tell if that's artistic
		direction, technological limitation, or both. And the character is
		straight up boring; slow, weak, and his outfit makes him look like
		a young Donald Trump escaping a mental institution.

		[[./prince_of_persia-1.png]]

		I spent far too long trying to get past this part. Finally I broke
		down and watched a walk-through; this place is a dead-end. Crap.

		[[./prince_of_persia-2.png]]

		The deaths are pretty brutal though, so there's that

		[[./prince_of_persia-3.png]]

		All in all, this game must have been innovative and influential in
		it's day, but it has not aged well. I found it boring and
		frustrating.
