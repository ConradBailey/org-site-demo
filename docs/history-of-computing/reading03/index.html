<h1>Reading 03: Console vs. Computer</h1>

The most obvious difference between console and computer is the
interface. A keyboard just has so many more buttons! You can customise
key-mappings and attribute complex sequences to a single keypress. And
a mouse has proven to be faster and more accurate than a d-pad or
joystick for most applications. Combine that with the left and right
clickers and a clever game designer won't even need the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
Next up is the difference in technology. These are the relase dates
for the Playstation consoles: 1995, 2000, 2006, and 2014. That means
graphics can't get any better, processors can't get any faster, and
games can't get any bigger for 5 to 7 years. Not to mention the
systems are designed years before release, so the technology is
necessarily already outdated when the first customer purchases the
console. PC's do not suffer the same way; their hardware can be
updated at will. This also aloows computer gamer designers to design
with an eye towards the future; relying on the promise that certain
technological advancements will have been made by the time their game
is ready.
</p>

<p>
So it's really these differences that underpin the cultural
differences between the two paradigms. PC's have incredible interface
and technological capabilities, at the price of steep learning curves
and maintenance. Consoles have technological limitations, but they
carry a promise to the customer to 'just work'. It's always easier to
put a cartridge into a slot than it is to install software. You can be
upside down on a sofa 20 feet from your big screen TV and use a
controller, but you have to be upright at a desk to use a mouse and
keyboard.
</p>

<p>
And so naturally video-game consumers diverge along these
lines. Players looking for a catered, streamlined, 'casual' experience
will find themselves leaning towards console gaming. Players looking
to micro-manage their own experience look towards a PC to provide that
level of customization. Studios are aware of this divide, and produce
games accordingly. You won't find games like Civilization or Star
Citizen on consoles because they are incredibly complex to play and
require complex interfaces and interactions that are only suitbale for
mouse and keyboard. Likewise the most popular console games like Super
Mario Bros. or Fifa will not be the most popular PC games because
they're just more fun and more comfortable on a console.

<h3 id="sec-2-1">Apple II</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
I never owned an Apple II, and I don't think I've ever interacted
with one. I have vague memories of Macintosh computers in our
computer lab back in kindergarten in 1998, but I don't think they
were Apple II's.
</p>

<p>
Despite having no personal history with the machine, I'm very aware
of its place in history, so I was excited to explore this platform
first.
</p>

<h4 id="sec-2-1-1">Strip Poker - Melissa &amp; Suzi</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
Lol, just kidding. I didn't play that game. For class anyway.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-1-2">Pacman</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2">
<p>
I'm starting here because so far it's a good standard to compare
platforms - everybody's gotta have a Pacman clone.
</p>

<p>
The first thing I noticed was the weird colors
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./pacman-1.png" alt="pacman-1.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
I was under the impression that the Apple II was
monochromatic. After some research I've found that color on the
Apple II was <a href="https://www.xtof.info/blog/?p=768"><i>not simple</i></a>. On top of that there were a few
different versions of the Apple II, so it's difficult to know what
exact configuration is being emulated. Suffice to say, when color
on the Apple II is just one of Woz's famous hacks, and operates
like it; notice the low resolution and interference between
adjacent colors. In light of these quirks, I assume some
compromises must be made graphically, like the size of the fruit.
<img src="./pacman-2.png" alt="pacman-2.png" />
</p>

<p>
The Apple II did not have up/down arrow keys, only left/right, so
Pac-Man uses A and Z for up and down. It's weird for me, but
probably somewhat natural on that hardware. The game feels a
little slower than the arcade version, but leaps and bounds ahead
of the Atari 2600 version!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-1-3">Lode Runner</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-3">
<p>
I decided to try this game next because I've never heard of it,
but it's on everybody's top ten Apple II list. Of note, it's the
first game to feature a level editor! It's a puzzle and platformer
mix, again another first.
</p>


<p>
The game starts off with a fancy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_transition#Iris_wipe">iris wipe</a>, <img src="./lode_runner-1.png" alt="lode_runner-1.png" /> so
            that's pretty impressive. The designer has chosen his color
            pallete to minimize interference. The gameplay feels really
            smooth, and only one hand is required (i, j, k, l, u, o), so the
            game is very easy to get sucked into right away.
</p>

<p>
I got to level 3 before deciding to move on. I know, pics or it
didn't happen.
<img src="./lode_runner-2.png" alt="lode_runner-2.png" />
</p>

<p>
This game was really excellent, and still the work of only one
person, Doug Smith. The idea of putting the power of creative
expression into the player's hands is an, ahem, <i>game changing</i>
innovation.

<h3 id="sec-2-2">DOS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
I'm not sure if I've ever interacted with a real DOS machine. I
barely remember the first computer my family had; it was about the
size of a microwave and I didn't touch it because if I did I would
probably get blamed for the crashes that plagued the damn thing and
destroyed my parents' unsaved work. It might've been running
Windows 95, maybe Windows 3.X, or maybe DOS. Can't remember.
</p>

<p>
The graphics are much closer to the arcade version than many other
platforms. They nailed the melodic sound effects used during
transitions, but the gameplay sounds are terrible. They replaced
'wacka-wacka' with varying siren sounds that are just grating. It
also appears the color pallete was restricted to the spectrum
between green and red, which is not nearly as appealing as the
bright neons and high contrasts of the arcade game. The speed
seems closer to the arcade than other platforms, but still a
little too slow. For an off-brand port it's alright, but I can't
get sucked into it like the arcade version, it's just that little
bit off.
</p>

<p>
I mean seriously, these colors look like a set of 70's
plastic-ware.

<h4 id="sec-2-2-2">Prince of Persia</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-2">
<p>
I picked this out because I played its successors on Playstation
2, and they were fantastic!
</p>

<p>
Boy, this game isn't like those <i>at all</i>. I mean, the protaganist
is male, it takes place in Persia, and he can jump, kinda, but
that's where the similarities end. This character is <b>sluggish</b>. I
feel like I'm pushing him through the effects of a poorly timed
Ambien. I have to press jump 2 steps before the gap. The climbing
mechanics are obscure. The field of vision is so small I get a
claustrophobic sense, but I can't tell if that's artistic
direction, technological limitation, or both. And the character is
straight up boring; slow, weak, and his outfit makes him look like
a young Donald Trump escaping a mental institution.

<p>
I spent far too long trying to get past this part. Finally I broke
down and watched a walk-through; this place is a dead-end. Crap.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./prince_of_persia-2.png" alt="prince_of_persia-2.png" />

<p>
The deaths are pretty brutal though, so there's that
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./prince_of_persia-3.png" alt="prince_of_persia-3.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
All in all, this game must have been innovative and influential in
it's day, but it has not aged well. I found it boring and
frustrating.
