Whether it is in the theater or in your living room, computer graphics
play a significant role in modern film-making and video games. How
important are these visuals to you in terms of the overall experience?
Consider, when do graphics detract rather than enhance these mediums
and how do you compare modern 3D computer graphics to older say
hand-drawn animation or 2D sprite-based graphics?

* What Do Visuals Contribute?
	It's difficult to approach these topics while avoiding defining what
	art is, because generally video games, movies, and imagery are
	mediums and computers are tools. So it's akin to asking what the
	[[http://www.radiolab.org/story/211119-colors/][color blue]] contributes to the overall experience of a painting.

	The importance of visuals, like any tool in the making of art, lies
	in /whatever it _uniquely_ provides/. Oils give a painting visual
	texture; lyrics give music a narrative; visuals allow us to share a
	visual experience to the exact detail. Few can build a world with
	words like Tolkien, but the tale could not visually enter the
	collective consciousness without Peter Jackson's help.

	[[http://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/balrog-gif-10.gif]]

	Furthermore, computers allow us to create visuals that would
	otherwise be impossible, or at least impractical. How else do you
	animate a giant, flaming hellspawn? Here's one example of a visual
	that's absolutely integral to the art: Superman flying. You can't
	make a Superman movie without Superman taking flight, one fist
	forward, cape fluttering in the wind. If Superman doesn't take
	flight, or worse he does and it looks /bad/, the movie is ruined.
	[[yt:T0D7ovW5_nM]]

	Every time I've watched /Superman/ with my dad he tells me how the
	whole theatre cheered when Superman gets his wings in the Fortress
	of Solitude. On the flip side, if you want to experience the
	frustration of a none-flying Superman just watch the first
	nine-and-a-half seasons of /Smallville/. Here's a hint: this
	indestructible idiot is /afraid of heights/. And [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qApzGWJ7JsE][Amy Adams starts
	off fat, then eats a deer]].

	Still, graphics are important even if there are no shots essential
	for the audience. /Toy Story/ is a brilliant comedy, CGI aside, and
	would have been a smash hit as a classic 2D animation. But the
	graphics allow for live-action slapstick /and/ cartoonish
	exageration. They are amplifying an already fantastic story.

	So graphics are important in two ways: they give artists greater
	story telling capabilities, and may even be essential to meet an
	audience's expectations.

* Just the Bad and the Ugly
	Bad graphics can completely de-rail a good story. They rip an
	audience out of whatever immersion they may have had. Your mind
	can't focus on anything else because it's often just the sense that
	somethings /a little bit off/. Something doesn't quite fit
	right. I'm talking about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley][uncanny valley]].
	[[https://www.therobotsvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/uncanny_graph_blog.jpg]]
	I *hate* /The Polar Express/. I hate that it was the bandwagon
	Christmas film of whatever godforsaken year it came out. Making it
	completely in CGI serves no purpose, except maybe saving money. All
	of the characters are offputting. The know-it-all is worse than Jar
	Jar by an order of magnitude or more. This film took a touching book
	and transformed it into an offputting festival of jerk kids, jerk
	conductors, a jerk hobo, and jerk elves that sound like they're on
	the brink of stage four throat cancer.
	[[yt:yZ9LmDUG3xg]]

	Bad graphics ruin good movies. Animators don't get any points for
	coming close; either do it well or don't do it at all. A more subtle
	instance is this fight scene that shatters immersion when it can't
	decide if it's live action or animated.

* Cartoons, Sprites, and 3D
	It appears American cinema will not see any major 2D releases again
	soon, and that's a shame. The medium drives infects the form and can
	produce artefacts that don't have a 3D superior or even equal.

	For instance, the master work that is /Fantasia 2000/ [[yt:qWJ-kGuOA_Q]]
	or the movies of Studio Ghibli. They execute the "every frame a
	painting" philosophy to a degree that has not been attained by 3D
	animation.
	[[https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--aLNrrSHg--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/191g42fso59kzgif.gif]]

	3D graphics are more capable though. I can't imagine persuading a
	Disney exec to make another princess cartoon in the post-Frozen
	era. The format is also often a product of the subject. Superheros,
	as we saw earlier with /Superman/, require much care (read, M$NEY)
	in a live-action or digitally enhanced format. But a cartoon handles
	them effortlessly; it's literally a moving, talking comic book! But
	/Toy Story/ is best handled with CGI; they're literally talking,
	moving toys!

* Reviews
** /La Faim/ (/Hunger/) - 1974
	 [[yt:eqMKy74HKXs]]

	 This is a short film by Peter Foldes, a pioneer of
	 computer animation. For this film Foldes used a computer to aid in
	 the "key frame" process, where the lead animator (Foldes) produces
	 the most important images, the key frames, and the assistants
	 (software in this case) produce all the frames in between. With the
	 help of Nestor Burtnyk's software package Folde's key frames
	 "glide" from one to the next.

	 When combined with Foldes' stark, grotesque imagery the effect is
	 chilling. It's a very concentrated example of graphics amplifying
	 the narrative: the style pins a visceral gross feeling to the
	 gluttony it portrays.

** /Arabesque/ - 1975
	 [[yt:sQrq7S0dP54]]

	 What do you get when you mix sitar music, psychedelics,
	 oscilloscopes, and Lite-Brites? Probably this.

	 It's sine waves exhibiting interference and resonance. Sometimes
	 with colors. It's pretty to look at, but I think I'm just too far
	 removed in time to completely appreciate it as a technological
	 demonstration.

** /TRON/ - 1982
	 The story is weak and the editing is bad. But boy oh boy is the
	 premise and the aesthetic great! This is an edge case for me where
	 the graphics actually /make up/ for the bad story. Once again the
	 graphics fits the subject material like a glove: it's walking and
	 talking computer programs!

	 At the time the neon outlines and 3D modeling was a completely new
	 aesthetic, and it is immediately intruiging. It's a completely
	 intuitive portrayal of the inside of a computer.

	 They cleverly filmed the actors in a grainy black and white. This
	 allows them to blend in more easily with the special effects,
	 especially in regards to lighting. It can also provide a dramatic,
	 old time movie feeling like /Nosferatu/.
	 [[./old_timey.png]]

	 The only "glitches" occur when actors must interact with computer
	 generated scenery, like steps and depth. But then sometimes they
	 /nail it/ like this scene where Crom holds on for his life.
	 [[./hanging_on.png]]

	 My favorite effects are building the light-cycles
	 [[./build_cycle.png]]

	 Seeing the light-cycle internals
	 [[./in_cycle.png]]

	 But oddly not the actual light-cycles. I find those visuals pretty
	 boring. They look like every 3D-Modeling demonstration since the
	 beginning of time. Maybe I am just too far removed in time and this
	 stereotype is a result of these graphics.
	 [[./cycle_grid.png]]

	 I much prefer when there is some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise][noise]] in the lights. If you look
	 closely you'll see the robed figures are standing on nothing, and
	 in action the animated surface isn't /quite/ angled like the real
	 one Jeff Bridges walks down.
	 [[./noise.png]]

	 Also, Ram has just about the /weirdest/ death scene. It's all
	 smiles, semi-pained expressions, and wide eyes. I want to know what
	 the director was saying that inspires a man to behave this way.
