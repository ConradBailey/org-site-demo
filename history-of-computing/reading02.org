* Pitfall!
	My mother is the only other person in my family who enjoyed video
	games, and she only really enjoyed three: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris][Tetris]] ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entertainment_Pack][Windows
	Entertainment Pack]]), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columns_(video_game)][Columns]] (Sega Genesis), and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall:_The_Mayan_Adventure][Pitfall: The Mayan
	Adventure]] (Win95). So Pitfall was a real outlier. I'd watch her for
	hours as she hoarded boomerangs in anticipation of the boss battles
	against one, sometimes two jaguars, or god forbid she made it all
	the way to the giant golem. So naturally I looked to play its
	ancestor first.

	Immediately I recognized the scorpion because Mayan Adventure paid
	homage by shoehorning this primitive graphic into its 16-bit
	environment.

	I found the controls intuitive, but then again I've been playing
	video games since I could barely read. The objective is not
	immediately clear, but there's clearly a 20 minute time limit for
	whatever it is. I found that if I went far enought to the right
	there was a silver/gold bar of some sort.

	Graphically this game far outshines many of the other 2600
	games. There's lush, varied backgrounds and interesting combinations
	of scenery. The running animation is smooth, the vine animation is
	clean, and he even sinks into the pits if you fall in. The sound
	effects are sparse but fitting, especially the Tarzan warble when
	jumping off a vine.

	Without a manual my instincts told me that each screen was being
	randomly generated and probably just went on into infinity, the
	objective being to achieve the highest score before time runs
	out. It's not an unreasonable hypothesis; many popular games were
	designed without an end-game like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. I was not
	very motivated to play the game if that objective was in fact true;
	thankfully my hypothesis was wrong.

	After doing some research I found that there is 32 pieces of
	treasure to be collected in the time limit, and the map is
	deterministic. That's a great feature; I immediately want to map out
	the whole game, take measurements, and strategize the best path for
	completing the objective. And then once you've got a handle on
	collecting the treasure, you can further refine your skill in
	pursuit of a perfect score! The research also brought up this great
	[[http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014632/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PITFALL][post-mortem]] by the author, David Crane. The amount of ingenuity that
	saturates every aspect of this simple, primitive game is astounding!

* Yar's Revenge
	I remember playing this as a kid somehow. Maybe it was on the
	internet, or at a friends house, or maybe it's been implanted in me
	for some nefarious reason. Nonetheless, I remember being attracted
	to the rainbow stripe of static and the cover art. The name
	immediately triggers that sci-fi sense, that there's something cool
	underlying the art and everything. Who is Yar? Who is Yar seeking
	revenge against? And for what?

	[[./yars_1.png]]

	I mentioned the 'void' of a black TV screen in an earlier post, and
	boy does Yar's take advantage: there's no frame! Every other 2600
	game I've played had some frame that seperates the score and other
	information like that from the field of gameplay. I think it's a
	great decision that amplifies the immersion.

	I'm a sucker for rainbows and I still love the static stuff. Come to
	find out, it's actually the game's source code just loaded into the
	graphics registers! Atari's legal department got wind of this and
	was worried someone might steal the code by piecing together
	screenshots. They weren't satisfied with the copyright situation
	until the author put the static through a masking process before
	displaying!

	I kind of like zoning out with this game. It's simple, and pretty
	unchanging, but challenging.

* Tennis
	This game is not much fun. The computer is frustratingly good, and
	there's little in the way of strategizing. It took me a while to
	determine shot angle was based mostly, if not entirely, on the
	distance between the ball and player when it is struck. Therefore to
	get a good shot off you must risk missing the ball entirely. The
	graphics are very dull, and little to no need to approach the
	net. In sum it was boring, difficult, and unrewarding.

* Conclusions
	I think the thing that makes these games so memorable is their role
	in video game history. The objective from a design perspective was
	not to make the player hemorrage quarters, but instead to engage and
	entertain. So to that end, every new innovation they made was new
	for the field over all. Pitfall introduced players to a sidelong
	platformer. Yar's Revenge brought explosions and psychedelic colors
	to an often drab library of games. Players were introduced to new
	paradigms as they were invented.

	These games also demonstrate the intrinsic relationship between
	games and their platform. The authors had to first ask themselves
	what they were /capable/ of creating with the 2600, and only after
	they had convinced themselves of the answer could they begin to ask
	themselves what they /wanted/ to create. /Pitfall!/ was crafted
	around a running man animation the author invented two years
	prior. The author of /Adventure/ was told by his boss not to pursue
	the impossible, but he proved him wrong and built a game around this
	counter-proof. Every memorable game was a bold experiment who's
	success was completely unpredictable. These games were the work of
	individuals, not teams, and they sometimes even bare their
	signature. These are the symptoms of art pieces. Rudimentary though
	they may be, they pushed the frontier of their medium
	technologically and artistically.

	From this relationship we may extrapolate that new technology will
	always inspire new gaming paradigms. But I doubt any technological
	advance today could inspire the kind of creative fervor that
	followed the invention of the format.
