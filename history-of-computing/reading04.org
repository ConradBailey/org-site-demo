* What Makes a Console?

  It seemed like I always had the wrong console. I had Genesis and all
  my friends had Nintendos. I had an N64, but all of my friends had
  Playstations. I must have been the only kid in the school district
  with a Dreamcast and without a PS2.

  There's a simple reason for this; price and timing. I knew better than
  to ask for expensive presents, and I never had any money of my own, so
  I just didn't have reason to pay attention to video game news. My
  parents tried their best though; they knew I loved video games whether
  I asked for them or not. So they did their research and just got
  unlucky; they always got the cheapest console that was still
  competitive, but they were cheap because they were unpopular. They
  could have done a lot worse and gotten a Saturn or a Jaguar, and I
  love the libraries I accumulated for the machines I had, but my
  experience with video games would be in isolation. I didn't worry
  about getting better at games to beat my friends, because they never
  wanted to play my games, so I could focus on playing the games I
  wanted to play in the exact way I wanted to play them. Some of the
  games I spent the most time on I never beat, like Sonic. I just spent
  all of my times scouring the map, drawing my own guides, looking for
  every last secret room and hidden message.

  Despite my experience, I think the most important difference between
  consoles is their library of games. Without games consoles are just
  expensive CD/DVD/Blu-Ray/Netflix players, or completely
  useless. What makes a great catalog of games is quality, quantity,
  and marketing. Nintendo always had a moderate quantity of high
  quality games, and marketing to match. I was too young for the
  edgy-ness of the Genesis campaign; but I saw Kirby, Mario, Zelda,
  and Donkey Kong every time I walked into a video rental place, or
  picked up a Nintendo Power in the school library. The Genesis had
  great marks in every category, but the Dreamcast had fewer titles,
  but a handful of extremely high quality, and crap marketing. Most of
  my friends had no idea what a Dreamcast was until they came to my
  house. Playstation had more high quality games than any system
  before it. All of my friends had Spyro and Crash Bandicoot. I had
  one friend just down the street who owned Legends of Dragoon; that
  game required /*four CDs!*/ I was so jealous. I knew I loved RPGs,
  and I was just heartbroken that I couldn't participate in the Final
  Fantasy series. Sony's marketing was know joke either, but it came
  hand in hand with star characters like [[http://www.darkspyro.net/skins/set/images/random_full/random_spyro_set.jpg][ Spyro the Dragon]], [[http://omegaswords.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ff7-cloud.jpg][Cloud and
  his Buster Sword]], and [[http://media.gamestats.com/gg/image/object/002/002128/Tomb_Raider_2_PS1Box.jpg][Lara Croft's...polygons]]. They were fresh and
  badass, practically selling themselves based on imagery alone.

  So what makes a console? Its games and their marketing. What makes
  good games? Gameplay and great characters, both of which can be
  aided, but not solved, by improved hardware. And then finally
  there's price, but it is not as important as you might imagine in
  America. Perhaps in the early days uneducated parents made decisions
  with heavy financial consideration, but in today's market customers
  are well informed and willing to budget for exactly what they want,
  no matter their income.

	Game Boy is an outlier I believe. Nobody thinks of a Game Boy as a
	console; it is virtually a category unto itself. The thing was truly
	ubiquitous because it had the hottest game the industry has /ever/
	seen, Pokemon. Even I had a translucent purple Game Boy color, but
	the only games I owned were Pokemon Red and Blue. The PSP came and
	went. I think I knew one kid with a grandma who owned a
	GameGear. But for two or three years it was difficult to find a
	single boy on the playground without a gameboy and a Pokemon
	cartridge. So it is truly unfair to lump Game Boys in with
	non-portable consoles.

* Game Reviews
** Sex Vixens From Space
		[[https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.40850.sp18/reading04.html][I didn't make this one up]]

** Wolfenstein 3D
		This game is well known for popularizing the first-person shooter,
		and probably more famous for being the predecessor to DOOM. I have
		never played it before, but I've heard of it.

		I began play and immediately felt crippled by the lack of
		crosshairs. Apparently this protagonist carries his firearms at
		his belly button perpendicular to his body, at all times.

		I couldn't really get a grip on the strafing mechanics either,
		there's some disconnect between my mental model of the environment
		and how the controls operate in it. I believe both of these
		observations stem from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting][ray-casting]] used to generate the 3D
		graphics. I must admit it is super fast graphically, which I
		suppose was really the point in its day. I like to binge games,
		playing for many, many hours at a time; but this might be a little
		too fast with such low resolution, it's taxing to play for me.
