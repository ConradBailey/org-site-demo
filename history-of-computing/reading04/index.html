<h2 id="sec-1">What Makes a Console?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
It seemed like I always had the wrong console. I had Genesis and all
my friends had Nintendos. I had an N64, but all of my friends had
Playstations. I must have been the only kid in the school district
with a Dreamcast and without a PS2.
</p>

<p>
There's a simple reason for this; price and timing. I knew better than
to ask for expensive presents, and I never had any money of my own, so
I just didn't have reason to pay attention to video game news. My
parents tried their best though; they knew I loved video games whether
I asked for them or not. So they did their research and just got
unlucky; they always got the cheapest console that was still
competitive, but they were cheap because they were unpopular. They
could have done a lot worse and gotten a Saturn or a Jaguar, and I
love the libraries I accumulated for the machines I had, but my
experience with video games would be in isolation. I didn't worry
about getting better at games to beat my friends, because they never
wanted to play my games, so I could focus on playing the games I
wanted to play in the exact way I wanted to play them. Some of the
games I spent the most time on I never beat, like Sonic. I just spent
all of my times scouring the map, drawing my own guides, looking for
every last secret room and hidden message.
</p>

<p>
Despite my experience, I think the most important difference between
consoles is their library of games. Without games consoles are just
expensive CD/DVD/Blu-Ray/Netflix players, or completely
useless. What makes a great catalog of games is quality, quantity,
and marketing. Nintendo always had a moderate quantity of high
quality games, and marketing to match. I was too young for the
edgy-ness of the Genesis campaign; but I saw Kirby, Mario, Zelda,
and Donkey Kong every time I walked into a video rental place, or
picked up a Nintendo Power in the school library. The Genesis had
great marks in every category, but the Dreamcast had fewer titles,
but a handful of extremely high quality, and crap marketing. Most of
my friends had no idea what a Dreamcast was until they came to my
house. Playstation had more high quality games than any system
before it. All of my friends had Spyro and Crash Bandicoot. I had
one friend just down the street who owned Legends of Dragoon; that
game required <i><b>four CDs!</b></i> I was so jealous. I knew I loved RPGs,
and I was just heartbroken that I couldn't participate in the Final
Fantasy series. Sony's marketing was know joke either, but it came
hand in hand with star characters like <a href="http://www.darkspyro.net/skins/set/images/random_full/random_spyro_set.jpg"> Spyro the Dragon</a>, <a href="http://omegaswords.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ff7-cloud.jpg">Cloud and
his Buster Sword</a>, and <a href="http://media.gamestats.com/gg/image/object/002/002128/Tomb_Raider_2_PS1Box.jpg">Lara Croft's&#x2026;polygons</a>. They were fresh and
badass, practically selling themselves based on imagery alone.
</p>

<p>
So what makes a console? Its games and their marketing. What makes
good games? Gameplay and great characters, both of which can be
aided, but not solved, by improved hardware. And then finally
there's price, but it is not as important as you might imagine in
America. Perhaps in the early days uneducated parents made decisions
with heavy financial consideration, but in today's market customers
are well informed and willing to budget for exactly what they want,
no matter their income.
</p>

<p>
Game Boy is an outlier I believe. Nobody thinks of a Game Boy as a
console; it is virtually a category unto itself. The thing was truly
ubiquitous because it had the hottest game the industry has <i>ever</i>
seen, Pokemon. Even I had a translucent purple Game Boy color, but
the only games I owned were Pokemon Red and Blue. The PSP came and
went. I think I knew one kid with a grandma who owned a
GameGear. But for two or three years it was difficult to find a
single boy on the playground without a gameboy and a Pokemon
cartridge. So it is truly unfair to lump Game Boys in with
non-portable consoles.

This game is well known for popularizing the first-person shooter,
and probably more famous for being the predecessor to DOOM. I have
never played it before, but I've heard of it.
</p>

<p>
I began play and immediately felt crippled by the lack of
crosshairs. Apparently this protagonist carries his firearms at
his belly button perpendicular to his body, at all times.

I couldn't really get a grip on the strafing mechanics either,
there's some disconnect between my mental model of the environment
and how the controls operate in it. I believe both of these
observations stem from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting">ray-casting</a> used to generate the 3D
graphics. I must admit it is super fast graphically, which I
suppose was really the point in its day. I like to binge games,
playing for many, many hours at a time; but this might be a little
too fast with such low resolution, it's taxing to play for me.
