My mother is the only other person in my family who enjoyed video
games, and she only really enjoyed three: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entertainment_Pack">Windows
Entertainment Pack</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columns_(video_game)">Columns</a> (Sega Genesis), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall:_The_Mayan_Adventure">Pitfall: The Mayan
Adventure</a> (Win95). So Pitfall was a real outlier. I'd watch her for
hours as she hoarded boomerangs in anticipation of the boss battles
against one, sometimes two jaguars, or god forbid she made it all
the way to the giant golem. So naturally I looked to play its
ancestor first.
</p>

<p>
Immediately I recognized the scorpion because Mayan Adventure paid
homage by shoehorning this primitive graphic into its 16-bit
environment.

I found the controls intuitive, but then again I've been playing
video games since I could barely read. The objective is not
immediately clear, but there's clearly a 20 minute time limit for
whatever it is. I found that if I went far enought to the right
there was a silver/gold bar of some sort.
</p>

Graphically this game far outshines many of the other 2600
games. There's lush, varied backgrounds and interesting combinations
of scenery. The running animation is smooth, the vine animation is
clean, and he even sinks into the pits if you fall in. The sound
effects are sparse but fitting, especially the Tarzan warble when
jumping off a vine.
</p>

<p>
Without a manual my instincts told me that each screen was being
randomly generated and probably just went on into infinity, the
objective being to achieve the highest score before time runs
out. It's not an unreasonable hypothesis; many popular games were
designed without an end-game like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. I was not
very motivated to play the game if that objective was in fact true;
thankfully my hypothesis was wrong.
</p>

<p>
After doing some research I found that there is 32 pieces of
treasure to be collected in the time limit, and the map is
deterministic. That's a great feature; I immediately want to map out
the whole game, take measurements, and strategize the best path for
completing the objective. And then once you've got a handle on
collecting the treasure, you can further refine your skill in
pursuit of a perfect score! The research also brought up this great
<a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014632/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PITFALL">post-mortem</a> by the author, David Crane. The amount of ingenuity that
saturates every aspect of this simple, primitive game is astounding!

<h2 id="sec-2">Yar's Revenge</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I remember playing this as a kid somehow. Maybe it was on the
internet, or at a friends house, or maybe it's been implanted in me
for some nefarious reason. Nonetheless, I remember being attracted
to the rainbow stripe of static and the cover art. The name
immediately triggers that sci-fi sense, that there's something cool
underlying the art and everything. Who is Yar? Who is Yar seeking
revenge against? And for what?
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
I mentioned the 'void' of a black TV screen in an earlier post, and
boy does Yar's take advantage: there's no frame! Every other 2600
game I've played had some frame that seperates the score and other
information like that from the field of gameplay. I think it's a
great decision that amplifies the immersion.
</p>

<p>
I'm a sucker for rainbows and I still love the static stuff. Come to
find out, it's actually the game's source code just loaded into the
graphics registers! Atari's legal department got wind of this and
was worried someone might steal the code by piecing together
screenshots. They weren't satisfied with the copyright situation
until the author put the static through a masking process before
displaying!
</p>

<p>
I kind of like zoning out with this game. It's simple, and pretty
unchanging, but challenging.

<h2 id="sec-3">Tennis</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
This game is not much fun. The computer is frustratingly good, and
there's little in the way of strategizing. It took me a while to
determine shot angle was based mostly, if not entirely, on the
distance between the ball and player when it is struck. Therefore to
get a good shot off you must risk missing the ball entirely. The
graphics are very dull, and little to no need to approach the
net. In sum it was boring, difficult, and unrewarding.

<h2 id="sec-4">Conclusions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
I think the thing that makes these games so memorable is their role
in video game history. The objective from a design perspective was
not to make the player hemorrage quarters, but instead to engage and
entertain. So to that end, every new innovation they made was new
for the field over all. Pitfall introduced players to a sidelong
platformer. Yar's Revenge brought explosions and psychedelic colors
to an often drab library of games. Players were introduced to new
paradigms as they were invented.
</p>

<p>
These games also demonstrate the intrinsic relationship between
games and their platform. The authors had to first ask themselves
what they were <i>capable</i> of creating with the 2600, and only after
they had convinced themselves of the answer could they begin to ask
themselves what they <i>wanted</i> to create. <i>Pitfall!</i> was crafted
around a running man animation the author invented two years
prior. The author of <i>Adventure</i> was told by his boss not to pursue
the impossible, but he proved him wrong and built a game around this
counter-proof. Every memorable game was a bold experiment who's
success was completely unpredictable. These games were the work of
individuals, not teams, and they sometimes even bare their
signature. These are the symptoms of art pieces. Rudimentary though
they may be, they pushed the frontier of their medium
technologically and artistically.
</p>

<p>
From this relationship we may extrapolate that new technology will
always inspire new gaming paradigms. But I doubt any technological
advance today could inspire the kind of creative fervor that
followed the invention of the format.
